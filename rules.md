# Development Rules

## Core Principles

### 1. Only Do What Asked
- **Strict adherence**: Only implement what is explicitly requested
- **No extras**: Do not add features, optimizations, or improvements unless specifically asked
- **Clear communication**: If additional work is needed, ask for permission first
- **Follow instructions**: Implement exactly as specified without deviation

### 2. No Sample Data or Content
- **Real data only**: Use actual API responses and real content
- **No placeholders**: Avoid fake descriptions, sample text, or placeholder content
- **No fallback text**: Do not create artificial content when real content is missing
- **Authentic content**: Only display genuine data from the API or user input

### 3. Use Most Effective Methods
- **Best practices**: Implement the most efficient and effective solution for each function
- **Performance first**: Choose methods that optimize speed, memory, and user experience
- **Modern approaches**: Use current best practices and recommended patterns
- **Optimized solutions**: Suggest and implement the most effective approach for each task

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow Flutter/Dart best practices
- Use appropriate error handling
- Implement proper state management

### Performance
- Optimize for speed and memory usage
- Minimize API calls and network requests
- Use efficient data structures and algorithms
- Implement proper caching strategies

### User Experience
- Ensure smooth and responsive UI
- Provide meaningful feedback to users
- Handle edge cases gracefully
- Maintain consistent behavior across the app

## Communication
- Ask for clarification when requirements are unclear
- Suggest improvements only when explicitly requested
- Provide clear explanations for implementation choices
- Document any assumptions or decisions made
